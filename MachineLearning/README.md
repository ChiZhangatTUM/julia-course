# Subsections

Each subsection is composed of an introductory presentation and a number of tutorials to engage with the code and concepts. The split
between "basic" and "advanced" content is mostly arbitrary and is done for the purpose of teaching flow.

## Basic Tutorials

* Regression in Flux
* Classification in Flux
* Gaussian processes using Stheno
* Variational inference in Flux

## Advanced Tutorials

* Amortized inference
* Reinforcement learning and metalearning in Flux
* Bayesian deep learning with Turing and Flux
* Solving inverse problems with Gen
* Differential programming with Zygote
