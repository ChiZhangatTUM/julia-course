# Machine Learning in Julia

Tutorials on machine learning in Julia including the use of:

* [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl)
* [Stheno](https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl)
* [Turing](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl)
* [Gen](https://github.com/probcomp/Gen)
* [DiffEqFlux](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqFlux.jl)
* [Zygote](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl)

# Subsections

Each subsection is composed of an introductory presentation and a number of tutorials to engage with the code and concepts. The split
between "basic" and "advanced" content is mostly arbitrary and is done for the purpose of teaching flow.

## Basic Tutorials

* Regression in Flux
* Classification in Flux
* Gaussian processes using Stheno

## Advanced Tutorials
