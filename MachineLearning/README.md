# Machine Learning in Julia

Tutorials on machine learning in Julia including the use of:

* [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl)
* [Stheno](https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl)
* [Turing](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl)

* [Zygote](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl)

# Subsections

Each subsection is composed of an introductory presentation and a number of tutorials to engage with the code and concepts. The split
between "basic" and "advanced" content is mostly arbitrary and is done for the purpose of teaching flow.

## Basic Tutorials

* Regression in Flux
* Classification in Flux
* Gaussian processes using Stheno

## Advanced Tutorials

* Variational inference and amortized inference in Julia
* Reinforcement learning and metalearning in Flux
* Bayesian deep learning with Turing and Flux
* Solving inverse problems with Gen
* Differential programming with Zygote
