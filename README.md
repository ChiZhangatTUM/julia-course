# Introduction to Julia for HPC and Machine Learning

Course content for the [LRZ](https://www.lrz.de) course on [Julia](https://julialang.org/) with a specific focus
on HPC and machine learning. The content builds up from the introduction to the basics of Julia including the
multiple-dispatch system and its vibrant package ecosystem to then advance Gaussian processes, Bayesian deep learning,
data-driven proposals and differential programming.
